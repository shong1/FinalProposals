\section{Introduction}

The main theme of the final project is reconstructing 3D face from multiple sources. 
The first part of the project follows a framework suggested in the `Face reconstruction from the wild'~\cite{Kemel2011}.
The authors proposed the 3D face reconstruction method from large unstructured image collections, such as, images from google search or personal photo collections. 

\section{Algorithm Overview}

\noindent \textbf{Normalize Face Images \\} 

Since images from internet or personal collections are unstructured, we need to normalize each image to a canonical face, which is frontal view of a face.
In ~\cite{Kemel2011}, they used a fiducial-based approach to normalize faces. They first detect a face in the image by using the object detection method using the soft cascade method~\cite{Bourdev05}.
Fiducial points of a face, such as, corners of eyes, nostrils, tip of a nose, and etc. are extracted from the detected region by using the fiducial points detection method ~\cite{Everingham06}. 
The matlab codes for the face detection method is provided by the matlab package and the fiducial points detection method is provided in the matlab Computer Vision package. 

Let $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ be the fiducials in 2D images and the 3D template shape. 
They assumed 2D mo
